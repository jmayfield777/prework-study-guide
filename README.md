# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to provide a study guide for developers starting their journey. I built this project to serve as a guide to hold tips and information regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This webpage demonstrates the basic tenets of HTML (providing a structure for your website), CSS (the styling of the website,), Javascript (making your website interactive and more dynamic), and Git (tracking your changes and adding them to the GitHub repository).
